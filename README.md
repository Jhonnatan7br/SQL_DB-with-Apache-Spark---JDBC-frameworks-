# SQL_DB-with-Apache-Spark---JDBC-frameworks-

This project is a demonstration of how to use Apache Spark and JDBC frameworks to connect to a SQL database and perform various operations on it. The project shows how to:

Create a Spark session and configure it to use the JDBC driver for the database.
Read and write data from and to the database using Spark SQL and DataFrames.
Query and analyze data using Spark SQL and various built-in and user-defined functions.

# Steps to connect to a SQL database using JDBC:

Load the JDBC driver: First, you need to load the JDBC driver for the database you want to connect to. You can do this by calling the Class.forName() method and passing the name of the driver class as an argument.

Establish a connection: Once you have loaded the driver, you can establish a connection to the database using the DriverManager.getConnection() method. You need to pass the URL of the database, the username, and the password as arguments to this method.

Create a statement: After establishing a connection, you can create a Statement object using the Connection.createStatement() method. This object is used to execute SQL statements against the database.

Execute a query: You can execute a SQL query using the Statement.executeQuery() method. This method returns a ResultSet object that contains the results of the query.

Process the results: Finally, you can process the results of the query by iterating over the ResultSet object and extracting the data you need.
